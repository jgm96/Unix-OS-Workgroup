Unix was created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. 
﻿Its principal characteristic is that its source code is exclusive. 
﻿It means that Unix is a brand registered like Windows. 
﻿With the pass of the years, Unix was selling its source code to serveral companies.
﻿The most important implementation of Unix is Mac OS X. Another one is BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution), 
but because of legal problems, Unix considered it as an Unix-like, it means, it's based in Unix but not certified by them. 
﻿In 1991 Linus Trovalds developed one of the most famous kernels in the history: Linux. It is Unix-like, but with the license of GNU.
Apart from Mac OS X, one of the most powerful operating systems certified by Unix is Oracle Solaris. 
This system was developed by Sun, company bought by Oracle later on.
