 Unix began its life on a scavenged PDP-7 minicomputer, as a platform
 for the Space Travel game and a testbed for Thompson's ideas about operating system design.
 
 The utility programs that Thompson and Ritchie wrote to support hosting game
 development on the PDP-7 itself became the core of Unix. The original spelling was “UNICS”
 (UNiplexed Information and Computing Service).
 
 Unix was very close to being the first system under which a programmer could sit down
 directly at a machine and compose programs on the fly, exploring possibilities and testing while composing.
 
 The Unix tradition of lightweight development and informal methods also began at its beginning.
 While Multics[1] had been a large project with thousands of pages of technical specifications written before the hardware
 arrived, the first running Unix code was brainstormed by three people and implemented by Ken Thompson in two days
 on an obsolete machine that had been designed to be a graphics terminal for a ‘real’ computer.
 
 Unix's first real job, in 1971, was to support what would now be called word processing for the Bell Labs patent department;
 the first Unix application was the ancestor of the nroff[2] text formatter.
 This project justified the purchase of a PDP-11, a much more capable minicomputer.
 
 The original Unix operating system was written in assembler, and the applications in a mix of assembler
 and an interpreted language called B, which had the virtue that it was small enough to run on the PDP-7.
 But B was not powerful enough for systems programming, so Dennis Ritchie added data types and structures to it.
 The resulting C language evolved from B beginning in 1971; in 1973 Thompson and Ritchie finally
 succeeded in rewriting Unix in their new language.
 
 In the following years, UNIX was starting to get known especially due to a report published in the Communications of the ACM
 magazine[3] in 1974. It defined UNIX as "a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system" and it offered "a number of
 features seldom found even in larger operating systems", giving as an example "a hierarchical file system", "the abilty
 to initiate asynchronous processes", a "system command language selectable on a per-user basis"...
 The report focused on the nature and the implementation of the file system and the command interfaces.
 It also referred to the hardware on which UNIX ran, which only had 144 Kbytes of core memory where 42 were used by UNIX.
 
 As soon as people knew that this OS had the capability of doing the things written on the report, lots of
 entities (universitites, research laboratories...) wanted to try UNIX. The problem was that in 1958 a decree stated that
 AT&T (the parent company of Bell Labs.) had been forbidden from entering the computer business, so UNIX couldn't be turned
 into a product. And according to some terms of the decree, Bell Labs had to license their products to everyone who asked.
 That was the reason why UNIX started to expand out of the AT&T corporation.
 
 Although the OS was free, the problem was the price of the hardware to ran it which was not especially cheap (around 40.000$).
 All over the world UNIX surprised people which tried it and people also made amazing things with this OS.
 Douglas Comer (a computing sciences' professor at Purdue University) gave some examples of achievements some people got:
  - "At Yale University, students and computer scientists modified the UNIX shell".
  - At Purdue University some departments made changes that allowed UNIX to handle a larger number of users.
  - At Purdue they had also created one of the first UNIX computer networks.
 
 At 1979 UNIX released Version 7. This was the first approach to the current UNIX systems, so any programmer using
 UNIX nowadays could perfectly understand anything which was on the Version 7. Some years before this, UNIX had already
 expanded all over the world, it came as far away as Australia, where John Lions (a computer scientist) developed
 the first serious kernel documentation for the Version 6. It was a highly valued thing for hackers, so many copies
 of this documentation were stolen from his computer. Due to some copyright problems, this documentation was illegal
 on the U.S.
 
 Everything was going perfect[4] until 1980, when Microsoft started selling a port of the AT&T UNIX version called XENIX[5].
 
 
 *1 (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) was one of the first time-sharing operating systems and it
    had a great impact in the development of the following operating systems.
 *2 nroff (abbreviation of "new roff") text-formatting program from UNIX that returns a suitable output
    for the format of printers and terminal windows.

 *4 At 1978, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) was built as the first Unix company, and the first commercial C
    compiler (WhiteSmith) was sold that same year.
 *5 It was a UNIX based operating system developed by Microsoft from a early UNIX license bought to AT&T.
    It used that name because Microsoft wasn't able to use the UNIX name.
