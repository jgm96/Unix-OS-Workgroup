CONCLUSION
	Finally, we can conclude that, despite of the recent fall in the use of Unix in desktop machines (we all know the low usage of Solaris OS and BSD distributions), Unix is probably the most important OS in the History. One of its implementations, the popular OS X is growing each day more. 
But this is not the main point. Unix served as the basis of almost every OS in the world. All the GNU Project derives from Unix, and almost all the IBM and HP Operating Systems too. All the file transfering systems, the shell, the protocols that were implemented were the base for future OS implementations.
“Unix wars” were a negative point in Unix history. In our opinion, market strategy of Sun Microsystems and its rival, the OSF, was not the correct and avoided the creation of a “genuine” Unix System, which would have been intresting as reference for the rest.
To conclude, we think that Unix usage is in certain way unknown for the population. Almost every web client is using Unix. Also, a big amount of servers. And we can’t forget, all the popular Linux distros are Unix-like OS…
